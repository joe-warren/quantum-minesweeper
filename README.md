# Quantum Minesweeper

Work In Progress Minesweeper Variant. 

The idea is, it's regular minesweeper.
Except, that, if you're in a position where the board is ambiguous, and you're forced to guess, you'll always hit a mine. 
There's a button, which you can press to reveal a square, _however_, if you press this while the board is _not_ in an ambiguous state, this is _also_ a loss condition.

It doesn't work yet, and I'm not convinced the concept is going to be _fun_, but it's at least possible.

Based on [this PureScript template](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen-template).
